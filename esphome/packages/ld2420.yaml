# We have a platform-defined "moving distance" sensor that updates value 
# whenever it senses movement. As such, when it updates value, we know some 
# movement happened. We then turn on the motion_detected sensor and launch
# a script that would turn it off after configured timeout:

script:

  # The script is in a "restart" mode, which means that if the moving_distance 
  # sensor updates before the configured delay, the script will end prematurely 
  # and a new instance will launch, thus delaying the turn off even further:
