This repository is a public copy of my personal [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) and [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) configuration, though mostly focused on the latter. It's intended as an example/inspiration â€” feel free to explore, fork, and adapt device configs or automation blueprints, but note this is not a collab project.

What you'll find here is a living config. Hope one day you'll find something of a worth for You in:
- [esphome/](./esphome/) â€” ESPHome device YAMLs and related files (search here for device-specific configs).
- [blueprints/](./blueprints/) â€” Home Assistant automation blueprints I use.

Some cloud-cutted, reflashed Tuya devices will hopefully appear here and I hope they will google well ðŸ™ƒ

This will be obviously growing over time, but as of a late 2025, don't expect a lot of fanciness ðŸ¤£

### Security & privacy
- I have intentionally omitted secrets (secrets.yaml, API keys, passwords) â€” do not expect them to be present ðŸ˜œ
- Friendly reminder: do not commit secrets if you fork, adapt and republish these configs for your needs. Use Home Assistant's [secrets.yaml](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/secrets/)!

### Usage notes
- Browse the files under the links above and copy device or blueprint files into your own Home Assistant / ESPHome setup. 
- Update GPIO pins and entity names to match your likings and hardware before deploying.
- It's a living personal config and may change over time.

### Support & contributions
- This repo is maintained by a single person. If you want help adapting a config for a specific device, open an issue or create a discussion in your fork - or contact me directly.
- If you found some issue and are willing to fix them at source, please fork and submit PRs from your fork - or just message me.
